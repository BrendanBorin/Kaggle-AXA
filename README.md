# Kaggle-AXA

These are the files I used to make predictions for Kaggle's AXA Driver Telematics Analysis challenge.

To use:
1) run Features.java to create files with calculated features for all drive files
2) run MakeSupervised.java to create labeled data sets for each driver
3) run learn.py to train a Random Forest and write out a prediction file that can be submitted
